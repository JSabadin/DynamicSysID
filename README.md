# Identification of Unknown Dynamic Systems

## Overview
This project focuses on the identification and modeling of unknown dynamic systems. We utilize a range of sophisticated methods to develop models that accurately represent these systems.

## Methods Used
The following methods have been employed for system identification:
- Orthogonal Correlation
- Least Squares Estimation (LSE)
- Recursive Least Squares Estimation (RLSE)
- Stochastic Approximation
- Empirical Transfer Function Estimate
- Spectral Analysis
- Instrumental Variables

Each of these methods contributes to building a robust and accurate model of the dynamic systems under study. 

## Detailed Methodology
For a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and their applications, please refer to the accompanying document: [IdentificationProject.pdf](IdentificationProject.pdf). This document provides an in-depth explanation of each method, along with the rationale behind their use.
